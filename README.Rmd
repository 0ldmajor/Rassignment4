## Readme

The repository contains:

1. a tidy data set "test_train_ordered" which is a merger of the training and the test sets of the accelerometers data contained in the files provided by the assignment.

2. a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. an R script "assignment.R" used to generate the above 2 data sets (NB: the working directory should be set to the folder containing the raw data)

4. A markdown file called CodeBook.md describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data in 1 and 2.
